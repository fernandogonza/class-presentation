                <h2>1870 - 1882 , Dimmishing the KKK</h2>
                 <p>After noticing the increase in violence revovling around the KKK group, the United States finally made actions to disband the group. In 1970, congress passed the FORCE ACT, in order to give rights to blacks with the 14th & 15th Amendments. 1971, the KU KLUX KLAN ACT was formed. This provided the president to combat attacks against black rights. Finally, in 1882, United States V. Harris declared the KKK as unconstitutional. The end of the first Ku Klux Klan wave.</p>

                <h2>1915 - The Birth of a Nation</h2>
                 <p>The revival of the KKK can be linked back to the film THE BIRTH OF A NATION. A pro-white supremency and patriotical film about defending southern beliefs, dirested by D.W. Griffith. The Film also inspired the White Knight persona and hooded costume for the KKK.</p>

     <h2>"From 1866 through 1871, men calling themselves ‘Ku-Klux’ killed hundreds of black Southerners and their white supporters, sexually molested hundreds of black women and men, drove thousands of black families from their homes and thousands of black men and women from their employment, and appropriated land, crops, guns, livestock, and food from black Southerners on a massive scale" - Elaine Frantz Parson, (Ku-Klux: The Birth of the Klan During Reconstruction)
